        implementing or made under or pursuant to or replacing or superseding the GDPR. Where this Privacy Policy uses terms, which are defined in the GDPR, then the definitions set out in the GDPR will apply.<br>
        "Personal Data" is data relating to you from which you can be reasonably identified. Examples of Personal Data include your full name, postal address, email address and telephone number. We recognise that your Personal Data is valuable and
        process your information in accordance with the European Data Protection law (hereinafter jointly referred to as "Data Protection Legislation").
      </p>

      <h2>DATA CONTROLLER</h2>
      <p>
        Web Syntax is responsible as data controller for the processing of your Personal Data collected on the Web Syntax website under the European Data Protection Legislation and the Australian requirements as applicable.

        We collect Personal Data to allow us to provide you with services and deliver information on the products and/or services offered by us. We make sure that the Personal Data we collect from you is necessary for and directly related to this
        purpose.<br>
        The type of Personal Data that we collect from you, will vary depending on the circumstances in which we are dealing with you. This information may include:<br>
        Personal details about you such as your name, gender, date of birth, residential and business addresses, telephone numbers, email and other electronic addresses;<br>
        If you have registered on our website, we may collect any information from your browser and our servers that may be connected to the contact details you gave when you registered, such as username, password, profession, company, etc. Other
        details relating to your relationship and dealings with us, including if we deal with you in a capacity other than a customer (for example, if you have applied for a position with us, pre-employment history, income, results of aptitude and
        other tests, contact and emergency details).<br>
        Information that you voluntarily provide to us through your responses to competitions, surveys, search functions, questionnaires, feedback, ratings and reviews and the like.<br>
        Credit card information we collect from you will go directly to our processor or bank and no personnel of Web Syntax will have access to this data. If you choose to purchase a product from us, our third-party payment processors will collect your
        payment information, and none of our personnel will have access to this data.<br>
        As a general rule, we do not collect sensitive information about you, such as racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health or condition, sexual orientation and judicial or
        criminal records ("Sensitive Information"). However, in circumstances where we require Sensitive Information from you for a lawful purpose, for example for the purpose of providing our services to you, we will seek your consent to collect
        Sensitive Information prior to collecting it.<br>
        We collect such Personal Data from you in a number of ways, including:
      </p>

        </li>
        <li>from our affiliated companies;</li>
        <li>from your representatives;</li>
        <li>from our agents or service providers when engaged by us to do so or by other third parties, such as from referees, to verify the information you have provided us or to assist us to locate or communicate with you from sources where you’ve
          made your information publicly available;</li>
        <li>from credit-reporting and fraud-checking agencies and credit providers for credit related purposes such as credit worthiness, credit rating, credit provision and financing;</li>

        <li>when legally required to do so.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We make sure that the way we collect data from and about you is lawful and fair in your circumstances.<br>
        We take all practical steps to ensure that you are informed of what data you are obliged to provide us, what data you may voluntarily provide us and what we may do if you do not provide us with data which you are obliged to provide.

        You should keep in mind that Internet transmissions (including emails) are never completely secure or error-free. As such, you should take steps to protect yourself, especially online and take special care in deciding which information you
        send to us via e-mail or other transmissions. Moreover, where you use passwords, ID numbers, or other special access features on the websites, it is your responsibility to safeguard them. You should choose a strong password, do not use the
        same password that you use on other websites and do not share your password with anyone else. Also remember to sign out of our websites and close your browser window when you have finished to ensure that others who may have access to your
        computer cannot access your personal information.<br>
